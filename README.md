### Hi! if you are reading this, you are probably interested on more information about me.

I am a student of Actuarial Science at UNAM (Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico/National Autonomous University of Mexico). I have a keen interest in the application of data science techniques, machine learning, and mathematical models in decision-making. I am skilled in programming languages such as Python and R, and I am comfortable adapting to new software and operating systems, with a preference for Unix-based systems.
